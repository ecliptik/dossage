# Licensing policy

Keep **engine code** separate from **game data**, always. See
`THIRD-PARTY.md` for how this applies to `shared/` itself.

## Never guess a license

The same "never guess" discipline that applies to an `upstream_url` in
`ports.yaml` applies to licensing: `upstream_license` stays `null` and
`upstream_license_verified: false` until someone has actually read that
project's own LICENSE/COPYING file (or equivalent) in the pinned revision
and recorded what it says, in `ports.yaml` and that port's own
`LICENSE-REVIEW.md`. A remembered or commonly-believed license is not
verification — this field governs what we are legally allowed to
distribute, modify, and how, so treat it with the same rigor as a legal
document, because it is one.

## Never contribute upstream

We do not send anything back to the projects we patch — no upstream PRs,
no issues, no bug reports, no mailing-list posts, about any vendored
source in `shared/` or in any port repo's own `vendor/`/`patches/`. All
patch and research work stays in this repository or the relevant port
repository. See `CLAUDE.md`'s "Never contribute upstream" section for the
full policy and rationale; it applies everywhere in this hub, in every
port repo, and in any harness/QA tooling (vcctrl included) touched while
working on a port.

## Every port needs a `LICENSE-REVIEW.md`

Before any release-packaging automation is built for a port, its repo
needs a `LICENSE-REVIEW.md` (template: `templates/LICENSE-REVIEW.md`)
tracking:

```
engine source license
DOS-specific patches license
SDL license
linked libraries
game asset license
music license
font license
redistribution rights
binary redistribution rights
source distribution obligations
```

## Every distribution/staging target needs the license file, not just the release one

A vendored binary's required redistribution-terms file (e.g.
`CWSDPMI.DOC`, required alongside `CWSDPMI.EXE` per its own license) has
to ship with *every* build target that copies the binary somewhere a
person could end up with just that copy -- not only the final `dist`/
release-packaging target. A real case: dossage/Passage's `make stage`
(used for quick real-hardware iteration, and per its own comments the
same tree pattern real-hardware CF cards get) installed `CWSDPMI.EXE`
but not `CWSDPMI.DOC`, even though the port's own `LICENSE-REVIEW.md`
required both -- the actual release-packaging target was compliant, this
quicker iteration path wasn't, and it's exactly the kind of gap that
only surfaces when someone writes down "copy these files to your DOS
machine" and actually checks. The same shape of gap was found, unfixed,
in doskutsu's own `stage` target during this same investigation (2026-08-31)
-- flagged for that repo's own maintainers, not fixed here since this hub
doesn't own that repo directly. When adding or reviewing a staging/
install/dist target for any port, check it copies every license file a
vendored binary's own terms require, not just whichever target happens
to be the one currently being tested.

## Never

- commit commercial game data
- commit copyrighted assets without explicit permission
- commit proprietary fonts
- commit music requiring separate permission

## Default model when licensing is uncertain

```
open engine
+
user-supplied original game data
```

This is the model doskutsu uses for Cave Story and is the safe default for
any new port — ship the engine, let the user supply their own legally
obtained copy of the game data.

## "Source available" is not "freely redistributable"

Several candidates in `ports.yaml` (VVVVVV in particular) have source
available under terms that are not automatically redistribution rights for
either source or compiled assets. Read the actual license before assuming
anything about what a finished port can ship.
