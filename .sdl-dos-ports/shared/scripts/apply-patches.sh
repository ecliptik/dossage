# apply-patches.sh -- apply patches/<name>/*.patch to vendor/<name>/.
#
# Patches are produced by `git format-patch` from a working branch in the
# vendor tree and numbered lexically (0001-, 0002-, ...). Ordering matters;
# patches assume earlier patches are already applied.
#
# Behavior:
#   1. For each entry in vendor/sources.manifest that has a concrete SHA
#      (not PIN_ME), `git reset --hard` the vendor tree to that SHA
#      (discarding any prior patches, so this is idempotent).
#   2. Apply every `patches/<name>/*.patch` in lexical order via `git am`.
#   3. If a patch fails to apply, abort the `git am` cleanly, print the
#      failing path, and exit non-zero.
#
# SAFETY: step 1's `git reset --hard` is destructive to anything sitting
# uncommitted in that vendor tree -- including hours of real investigation
# work, not just patch-series churn (a real incident: uncommitted
# vendor-tree edits were nearly lost to a routine `apply-patches.sh` run
# invoked for an unrelated vendor's patch review). Before resetting a
# vendor tree, this script refuses if that tree has uncommitted changes,
# unless APPLY_PATCHES_FORCE=1 is set. Commit (even to a scratch branch)
# or stash before running this against a vendor tree you're actively
# editing by hand.
#
# Run AFTER scripts/fetch-sources.sh (the patches assume the vendor tree
# is populated and at the pinned SHA).
#
# Usage:
#   ./scripts/apply-patches.sh                    # apply to all vendors
#   ./scripts/apply-patches.sh nxengine-evo        # only the named vendor
#   APPLY_PATCHES_FORCE=1 ./scripts/apply-patches.sh nxengine-evo
#                                                   # override the uncommitted-changes refusal
