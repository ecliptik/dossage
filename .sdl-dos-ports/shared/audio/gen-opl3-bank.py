# gen-opl3-bank.py -- convert a DMX OP2 (GENMIDI) FM bank into the shared
# OPL3 sink's (shared/audio/opl3_sink.{c,h}) DOPL3v1 runtime patch bank
# (shared/audio/opl3bank.dat).
#
# WHY this exists (DOS port context): the built-in 8-patch family-bucket
# fallback in opl3_sink.c sounds thin/clipped on real OPL3 hardware.
# opl3_sink_load_bank() will, when given a valid file, read a full
# 128-program General MIDI bank in the "DOPL3v1" binary format (see
# opl3_sink.h). This script generates that file from a license-clean source
# bank so the result is reproducible (the .dat is build output, not
# hand-authored bytes).
#
# SOURCE BANK, license verified by reading the actual file, not inherited
# secondhand: DMXOPL (DMXOPL3) by ConSiGno -- github.com/sneakernets/DMXOPL,
# pinned at commit e83c144a2e6d3c283e20f9d16d011126931892f5 (tip of the
# DMXOPL3 branch, last pushed 2018-07-13; GENMIDI.op2 itself last changed
# 2018-01-02, well before that, so this tip is a stable pin). That commit's
# LICENSE file was fetched and read directly -- plain, unmodified MIT
# License text. (DoomWiki's page for DMXOPL separately lists CC BY-SA 4.0;
# that secondhand claim is NOT what this pin's own repository LICENSE file
# says, and is recorded here only as a discrepancy, not a second license.)
# A modern full-GM OPL3 FM patch set voiced to approximate the Roland

#        calc; the SDL VoiceWritePatch helper does NOT write it to the chip)
#
# KNOWN APPROXIMATIONS (documented for the handoff, not bugs):
#  1. 2-op only. Our backend allocator is 18 x 2-op; OP2 "double-voice"
#     (fat) instruments carry a second 2-op voice we DROP -- we keep
#     voice #1, the primary. Still a large upgrade over the 8-patch set.
#  2. Per-patch transpose IS honored: OP2's int16 note-offset is emitted
#     into patch[11] as int8, and engine patch 0232 applies it in note_on
#     (playednote = midinote + patch[11]). All DMXOPL melodic offsets fit
#     int8 (-48..-7). This fixes the octave error that dropping the offset
#     would cause on ~110/128 programs. Diagnostics below count them.
