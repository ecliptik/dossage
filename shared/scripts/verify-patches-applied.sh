# verify-patches-applied.sh -- pre-flight that each vendor's commit count
# matches its patches/*.patch count.
#
# Non-destructive. For each vendor in vendor/sources.manifest with a concrete
# pinned SHA and a corresponding patches/<name>/ directory, compares:
#   - count of patches/<name>/*.patch (top level; excludes _disabled/)
#   - count of commits in vendor/<name>/ since the pinned SHA
#
# Mismatch means a patch landed in patches/<name>/ but was never `git am`'d
# to vendor/<name>/ (or vice versa: extra commits in vendor without
# corresponding patch files). Exits non-zero with concrete remediation.
#
# Catches the latent-failure-mode counterpart to the wave-38 stale-.obj
# root cause: the wave-38 patches DID `git am` to vendor (per the commit
# log timestamps), but the next time a patch lands in patches/<name>/
# without a manual `git am`, the build would silently produce a binary
# missing it -- `make patches` reorchestrates `apply-patches.sh`, this
# pre-flight verifies the resulting state matches expectations.
#
# Wired into the Makefile as a regular dependency of every build-stage
# convenience target (sdl3 / sdl3-mixer / sdl3-image / nxengine / all).
