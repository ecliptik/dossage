# setup-symlinks.sh -- wire this repo to the shared ~/emulators/ toolchain hub.
#
# The DJGPP cross-compiler lives canonically at ~/emulators/tools/djgpp/
# alongside the sibling projects (vellm, geomys, flynn). Symlinking it into
# tools/djgpp keeps the Makefile's PATH export project-local (no $HOME
# assumption in build rules) while not duplicating the toolchain.
#
# See ~/emulators/CLAUDE.md for the hub convention.
#
# Idempotent: re-running is safe. Will replace an existing symlink but will
# refuse to overwrite a real directory (in case someone manually installed
# DJGPP locally).
#
# Usage:
#   ./scripts/setup-symlinks.sh                 # link to ~/emulators/tools/djgpp
#   EMULATORS_ROOT=/other/path ./scripts/setup-symlinks.sh   # override hub location

# this script lives in shared/scripts/ (a git subtree or submodule inside

# resolves against $PWD. Override with SDL_DOS_PORT_ROOT=/path if invoking
# from elsewhere.
