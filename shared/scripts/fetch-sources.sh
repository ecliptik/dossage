#!/usr/bin/env bash
# fetch-sources.sh -- clone (or update) the five vendored upstreams per
# vendor/sources.manifest. Each entry specifies a URL, a tracking ref
# (branch or tag), and a pinned SHA.
#
# Behavior:
#   - If vendor/<name>/ is absent, clone shallow from URL.
#   - If vendor/<name>/ exists, fetch and reset --hard to the pinned SHA.
#   - If the manifest's SHA is the literal string PIN_ME, fetch the ref,
#     resolve its HEAD SHA, print it (for the operator to copy into the
#     manifest), and leave the working tree at that SHA. This is the
#     Phase-2 bootstrap convenience -- normal operation has concrete SHAs.
#
# Run AFTER scripts/setup-symlinks.sh (not strictly required, but build
# order is: symlinks -> fetch -> patches -> make).
#
# Usage:
#   ./scripts/fetch-sources.sh            # fetch all missing/out-of-date
#   ./scripts/fetch-sources.sh SDL        # fetch only the named entry
#   ./scripts/fetch-sources.sh --resolve  # resolve PIN_ME entries to concrete SHAs

# from that root).
# Override with SDL_DOS_PORT_ROOT=/path if invoking from elsewhere.
