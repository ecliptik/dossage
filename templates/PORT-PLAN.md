# <PORT NAME> — DOS port plan

## Research (do this before writing code)

- [ ] Upstream repo located and a DOS-appropriate revision chosen and pinned
      in `vendor/sources.manifest`
- [ ] License reviewed (`LICENSE-REVIEW.md` started)
- [ ] SDL/engine API surface inventoried (which calls, which subsystems)
- [ ] External dependencies inventoried (codecs, archive formats, fonts,
      networking, threading)
- [ ] Filesystem/platform assumptions inventoried (see
      `.sdl-dos-ports/docs/filesystem.md`)
- [ ] Minimum patch sequence to reach a compiling, linking DJGPP build
      proposed

## Milestones

Use the `dos_status` ladder from `templates/PORT-STATUS.md`. For each
milestone reached, note the commit/tag and, where relevant, a DOSBox-X
smoke-test result.

- [ ] BOOTSTRAP — cross-build environment set up, `shared/build/sdl3-dos.mk`
      included, project's own `vendor/sources.manifest` entry added
- [ ] COMPILES — engine compiles and links under DJGPP (SDL/audio/etc. may
      still be stubbed)
- [ ] STARTS — executable runs under DOSBox-X, SDL3 initializes, exits
      cleanly
- [ ] TITLE_SCREEN — native-resolution framebuffer opens, title/menu
      renders
- [ ] RUNMANIFEST wired — `.sdl-dos-ports/shared/include/runmanifest.h`'s
      `runmanifest_emit()` called at clean shutdown; a real
      `[RUNMANIFEST-BEGIN]`/`[RUNMANIFEST-END]` block confirmed in a
      captured log with real (non-placeholder) fps/duration values. Do
      this here, not deferred to OPTIMIZING — see `PORTING.md`'s reuse
      list for why.
- [ ] PLAYABLE — a representative slice is playable start-to-finish
- [ ] FULL_GAME — the complete game is playable
- [ ] OPTIMIZING — profiling-driven optimization pass (see
      `.sdl-dos-ports/docs/optimization.md`); real-hardware benchmarks
      recorded per `templates/BENCHMARK.md`
- [ ] RELEASE_READY — packaged without redistributed copyrighted assets,
      `LICENSE-REVIEW.md` complete, `gallery/<name>/` entry written in the
      hub repo

## Open questions / risks

<!-- e.g. audio decode cost on 486, licensing terms, engine features with
     no DOS equivalent -->

## Measured constants

<!--
Every number a probe, diagnostic, or instrumented run produces, so a
later hypothesis has to be reconciled against what's already measured
instead of independently re-derived. This is the single highest-leverage
habit from a real fps campaign on this hub: a probe run in the first hour
measured a delay primitive's real cost, and that exact number turned out
to be the answer to an unrelated-looking investigation hours later --
sitting unused the whole time because nothing forced later hypotheses to
be checked against it. Add a row the moment a probe/diagnostic produces a
number; check new hypotheses against this table BEFORE running a new
probe, not after. See PORTING.md and the benchmark skill.
